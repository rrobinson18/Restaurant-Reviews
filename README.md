# Restaurant Review

The goal: A **responsive** web app that functions on any device or screen size. Ensure the web app meets the highest development by achieving **accessibility** standards. An app designed to be **mobile-first**.

## Running the Application

1. Download or Clone the project
2. Run it locally

* In this folder, start up a simple HTTP server to serve up the site files on your local computer. Python has some simple tools to do this, and you don't even need to know Python. For most people, it's already installed on your computer.

* In a terminal, check the version of Python you have: `python -V`. If you have Python 2.x, spin up the server with `python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000` (or some other port, if port 8000 is already in use.) For Python 3.x, you can use `python3 -m http.server 8000`. If you don't have Python installed, navigate to Python's [website](https://www.python.org/) to download and install the software.

* With your server running, visit the site: `http://localhost:8000`.
